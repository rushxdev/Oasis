            <h4>America’s investment in Fogarty has paid rich dividends</h4>

            During the pandemic, in particular, we’ve seen researchers trained by our programs make scientific
            discoveries that contributed to international security. Take Jessica Manning, a former Fogarty fellow who
            now conducts malaria research in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Her team at the Ministry of Health sequenced the
            viral strain of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, infecting the first Cambodian patient and documented
            early the spread of this novel coronavirus outside of China.

            Similarly, Christian Happi, director of the African Centre of Excellence for the Genomics of Infectious
            Disease, Ede, Nigeria, sequenced the first SARS-CoV-2 genome in Africa. Happi was able to do it by adapting
            the sequencing and analytical pipelines that he’d created back when he was a Fogarty grantee studying Ebola.

            In Botswana, Sikhulile Moyo leveraged the skills he’d acquired while supported by a Fogarty HIV research
            training grant with Max Essex, Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, MA, to track COVID-19 mutations
            for his country’s Ministry of Health. Last November, he alerted the world of a new Omicron variant. Within
            six weeks, Omicron became the dominant global strain, challenging the ability of COVID vaccines to control
            its spread. In the Dominican Republic, William Duke, a national commission member, used what he’d learned as
            a Fogarty trainee to help create a national COVID-19 intervention plan to prevent and control the disease.

            Fogarty’s fostering of global health leaders is one way we advance scientific expertise while ensuring our
            nation’s biosecurity. Another is by finding effective ways to study abroad the same health conditions that
            affect our own population.

            Research conducted in Colombia, for example, may provide clues for preventing Alzheimer’s disease in the
            U.S. Fogarty support brought together neuroscientists Kenneth Kosik, University of California, Santa
            Barbara, and Francisco Lopera, University of Antioquia, Colombia, to study members of the largest-known
            family with an early-onset, rapidly progressive form of the disease. Over the years, Kosik and Lopera have
            trained local scientists, explored gene therapy targets, investigated biomarkers to monitor disease
            progression, and conducted drug trials in search of a cure for Alzheimer’s.

            Researchers in other fields also discover unique opportunities to investigate populations with high rates of
            disease. Siana Nkya, a Fogarty grantee based in Tanzania, has devoted her career to studying the genetic
            determinants of sickle cell disease, which affects many people around the world, including in the U.S. We
            hope that US-African partnerships might develop improved, affordable treatments and a cure for all patients
            with this devastating disease. Similarly, people in the U.S. have access to state-of-the-art HIV treatment
            studies in places around the globe where incidence rates are higher.

            Fogarty has supported many milestone achievements in HIV research over the years. Among them is a study that
            took place in nine countries. The research, led by Myron Cohen of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
            Hill, established that antiretroviral therapy can prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1 among couples in
            which one person is infected and the other is not. In fact, this research informs current HIV treatment
            recommendations worldwide, including in the U.S.

            Americans will also undoubtedly benefit from projects funded by Fogarty’s Global Brain and Nervous System
            Disorders Research across the Lifespan program. For example, psychologist Tatiana Balachova, University of
            Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, has designed an intervention for women in Russia to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum
            disorders. In another project in South Africa, Sandra and Joseph Jacobson, Wayne State University, Detroit,
            conducted the first-ever prospective longitudinal study of the syndrome. Findings from both projects are
            ripe for translation within an American context.

            Other examples of Global Brain program investigations with broad implications in our own country include
            studying early psychosis in China; capacity building for schizophrenia research in Macedonia; exploring
            family consequences from the Zika virus in Brazil; and studying dementia and related health and social
            challenges in Lebanon.

            These are just a few examples of Fogarty’s work and its unique mission. What is most remarkable about
            Fogarty is that just under 90 percent of our grants are co-funded by at least one other NIH institute,
            center, or office. Collaboration, both within borders and across them, is Fogarty’s formula for success.
